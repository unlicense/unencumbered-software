  "shortdesc": {
    "en": "A concise, intuitive and flexible syntax (macro) for trivial lambdas that eschews explicit (and often contextually-redundant) naming of parameter variables in favor of positional references, with support for a used or ignored &rest parameter and automatic declaration of ignored parameters when logical \"gaps\" are left in the positional references. Further convenience features are provided."
