    "en": "A macro that allows visual grouping of variables with their corresponding values (not necessarily 1:1) in calls to mapping operators when using an inline LAMBDA. It does so in a way that automatically supports virtually every existing and future mapping operator, all lambda keywords and FUNCALL/APPLY/MULTIPLE-VALUE-CALL variations."
